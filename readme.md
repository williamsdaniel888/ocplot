## Installation

Please ensure that you place [ICLOCS2](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/ICLOCS/) and the Ipopt files in the root directory, otherwise update the relevant files to reflect their file path. We recommend that you use the [OPTI](https://www.inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/) distribution of the Ipopt MEX file with ICLOCS2.
