## Project Roadmap

### Term 1

1. [x] Preliminary meeting (*29 October, 2018*)
2. [x] Initial project scope (*7 November, 2018*)
3. [x] Inception report (*8 November, 2018*)
    1. [x] Meeting with second marker (*9 November, 2018*)
4. [x] Literature review (*16 November, 2018*)
    1. [x] Annotated bibliography (*16 November, 2018*)
5. [ ] Problem formulation (**due 23 November, 2018**)
    - Decentralized control with no explicit communication, leader-follower structure
    - Payload attachment method to be determined (*likely to use cable suspension instead of rigid grasp*)
    - Optimal trajectory planning for the leader (*pre-planned or real-time to be determined*)
    - Control scheme for followers to be determined
6. [ ] Preliminary ICLOCS-ROS integration (**due 21 December, 2018**)
    - Single quadrotor to follow a straight line trajectory using minimal work
    - Trajectory planning using ICLOCS-MATLAB
    - Simulation of evolution using ROS
    - Visualization using Gazebo

### Term 2
1. [ ] ICLOCS-ROS implementation of formulated problem (**due 18 January, 2019**)
2. [ ] Interim report (**due 28 January, 2019**)

### Term 3
1. [ ] Final report and presentation
    1. [ ] Abstract and draft report (**due 3 June, 2019**)
    2. [ ] Final report (**due 19 June, 2019**)
    3. [ ] Presentation of results (**due 24-26 June, 2019**)
